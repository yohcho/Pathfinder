# Pathfinder

This web application provides a simulated environment where the user can see how various pathfinding algorithms go about seraching the path needed to travel from one node to another. Allows user to create a map in a matrix specificing walls, start point, and end point. 

## Algorithms Included

1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. A* Search Variation 1 (considering movement cost)
4. A* Search Variation 2 (w/o considering movement cost)
